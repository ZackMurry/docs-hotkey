# Actions for Formatting Text

## Heading

The _heading_ action changes the heading type of the selected text. Its configuration is simply the name
of the heading type. For example, a configuration of "Subtitle" would make the selected text a subtitle.

Headings 4-6 can also be used if they are first used manually, after which they appear on the menu.

!!! info "Tip"
    This action can be powerful when combined with heading-specific default styles.
    If you have a few text styles you reuse, then you can configure your headings with
    your styles. You can then easily switch between your styles by using a hotkey to change the heading.

## Align

The _align_ action changes the alignment of the current text. Its configuration can be "left", "center",
"right", or "justify".

## Indent

The _indent_ action adds or removes indentation from the current text. Its configuration accepts
an integer, which specifies how many times to indent or un-indent. A positive number will add
indentation, whereas a negative number will remove indentation.
