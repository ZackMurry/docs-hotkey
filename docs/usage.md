# Usage

Docs Hotkey supports over a dozen actions, which can automate wide-ranging tasks on Docs.
Many actions are adjustable, including through their configuration box and their "toggle" checkbox.

For example, consider this action:

<img src="/assets/screenshots/example-action.png" alt="Docs Hotkey screenshot of an action with toggle enabled" class='small-image' />

The **type** of this action is highlight, its **configuration** is yellow, and it can be **toggled**.

If an action can be _toggled_, then running it twice does nothing.
Using the above highlight example, if the action is run on already-highlighted text, then the highlight will be removed.
If the toggle box were unchecked, toggling would be disabled and running the action on highlighted text would have no effect.

The _Actions_ section of the documentation is dedicated to configuring specific actions, primarily on the configuration that can be passed
into each action.
For an introductory usage guide, see the [Getting Started](index.md#getting-started) section.

For reference, here is a list of all of the currently supported actions. Some of these actions do not have documentation yet, but typically
have default configurations that will show you the expected input format.
