Originally, it was made solely to add a highlighting shortcut, but other formatting shortcuts have since been added. Hotkeys can currently be configured to: Highlight in any color Bold Underline Italicize Change text color Change fonts Change font size Set heading type (e.g., Heading 1, Normal Text, Title) Strike through text Change alignment and indentation Add emoji reactions Add bulleted lists and set their spacing Clear all styles and remove specific styles Insert building blocks Execute add-ons Demo \u00b6 Installation \u00b6 Docs Hotkey is available for free on the Chrome Web Store . After installing the extension or updating a hotkey, you may need to refresh any Google Docs tabs. Alternatively, you may build the extension from its source code using the instructions on the Building from Source page. Getting Started \u00b6 As a simple introduction, we'll create a hotkey to highlight the selected text. To start, open a Google Doc and click on the Docs Hotkey extension in the toolbar. Then, click on the \"Add Command\" button. You've just created your first command! A command is run whenever a keyboard shortcut is pressed, and it directs Docs Hotkey on what actions to perform on the document. Give this new command a name and add a \"Highlight\" action by clicking \"Add action\" and selecting \"Highlight\" from the dropdown menu. The next textbox specifies the configuration for the action. In this case, the highlight action needs a color here, so we'll pick yellow. Click \"Save All\" to register your new command. Finally, navigate to chrome://extensions/shortcuts in your browser by typing it in the search bar. Find the section for Docs Hotkey and edit the shortcut for \"Slot 1\" \u2014 you can find this slot number for any of your commands on the extenion pop-up. Your hotkey is good to go! Select some text, press the keyboard shortcut you chose, and your text will instantly be highlighted. If you're having trouble getting it to work, you may need to refresh the Docs page.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#docs-hotkey","text":"","title":"Docs Hotkey"},{"location":"#overview","text":"Docs Hotkey is a free, open-source Chrome extension for creating custom keyboard shortcuts in Google Docs.

Many actions are adjustable, including through their configuration box and their \"toggle\" checkbox. For example, consider this action: The type of this action is highlight, its configuration is yellow, and it can be toggled . If an action can be toggled , then running it twice does nothing. Using the above highlight example, if the action is run on already-highlighted text, then the highlight will be removed. If the toggle box were unchecked, toggling would be disabled and running the action on highlighted text would have no effect. The Actions section of the documentation is dedicated to configuring specific actions, primarily on the configuration that can be passed into each action. For an introductory usage guide, see the Getting Started section. For reference, here is a list of all of the currently supported actions. Some of these actions do not have documentation yet, but typically have default configurations that will show you the expected input format.","title":"Usage"},{"location":"usage/#usage","text":"Docs Hotkey supports over a dozen actions, which can automate wide-ranging tasks on Docs.

The configuration specifies the color of the highlight, in one of two forms: The color name , as defined by Google Docs The hexadecimal (hex) representation of the color The name of a color can be found by opening the clicking the highlight menu and hovering over your desired color on the color palette. In the example below, the configuration \"light green 3\" would use the hovered color. Using a hex code offers a lot more flexibility, as you may pick virtually any color. To start, click the plus icon at the bottom of the highlight color pallete. Once you find a color you like, copy the hex code of the color (highlighted in the image below) and use this as your configuration. Bold, Italicize, Strikethrough, and Underline \u00b6 These actions do not take any configuration and modify the selected text as you'd imagine. Font \u00b6 The font action changes the font family of the selected text using the font selection menu. Make sure the font is visible on the font selection menu, either in the short list of recent fonts or in the longer list below it. Once your font is on the menu, simply use its name as the action's configuration. Hint The \"More fonts\" button allows you to change which fonts appear on the menu. Font Weight \u00b6 Some fonts have multiple weights , which modify the thickness and darkness of the font. The font weight action sets the font weight of the selected text. It can change the font weight to any of the available weights for the current font. The configuration specifies the name of the font weight. For example, if you want to use the semi-bold weight for Roboto, then use \"Semi Bold\" as your configuration. Note If the current font does not support the specified weight, it will keep the current font weight. Capitalize \u00b6 The capitalize action changes the capitalization of the selected text.
