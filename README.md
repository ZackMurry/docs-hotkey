# Docs Hotkey

Docs Hotkey allows for complex hotkey setups with simple configuration. Hotkeys can be set up to do the following:

- Highlight in any color
- Bold
- Underline
- Italicize
- Change fonts
- Change font size
- Set heading type (e.g., Heading 1, Normal Text, Title)
- Clear all styles (and remove specific styles)

A single hotkey can be configured to do several of these at once.

# Bugs and feature requests

Bugs and feature requests can be submitted on GitHub at <https://github.com/ZackMurry/docs-hotkey/issues> or emailed to <docshotkey@zackmurry.com>.

Bugs are very likely to occur when Google updates the UI for Docs. The `heading` action is particularly unstable.
